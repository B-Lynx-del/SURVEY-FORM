# 📝 Survey Form Project

This is a simple and responsive survey form built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It was inspired by a fun challenge on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), where I began exploring the creative side of coding through hands-on projects.

## 🚀 What It Does

The form collects user feedback or opinions using:
- Text inputs
- Radio buttons
- Checkboxes
- A dropdown menu
- A comment section

It’s styled for a clean, user-friendly experience, with basic layout and color elements to make it visually engaging.

## 🎨 Built With

- **HTML5** – for structure and semantic layout
- **CSS3** – for styling, layout, and form design
